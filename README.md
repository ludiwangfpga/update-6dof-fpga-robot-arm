# 🚀 save-to-github

One-command GitHub sync for Claude Code. Type `/save!` and your code flies to GitHub.

## 🔑 First-Time Setup

On first use, a GitHub login window pops up automatically. Copy the one-time code, press Enter to open your browser, and authorize. Easy peasy 🍋

You only need to do this once. After that, it's all autopilot ✈️
